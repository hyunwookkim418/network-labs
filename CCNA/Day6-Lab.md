## Credits

These labs were inspired by the instructional style and lab structure shown in the **Day 6: Analyzing Ethernet Switching** lesson from **Jeremy’s IT Lab CCNA course**. Jeremy’s clear explanations and practical demonstrations played a significant role in shaping the format and learning approach used in this repository.
